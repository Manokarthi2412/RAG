User Query,Expected Answer
What are Jenkins pipelines?,"Jenkins pipelines are automated workflows that allow for the continuous integration and delivery of software, defining stages like build, test, and deploy as code."
How do Jenkins pipelines work?,"Jenkins pipelines define a series of steps (e.g., build, test, deploy) in stages. These steps run sequentially or in parallel, automating the CI/CD workflow."
What is the difference between declarative and scripted pipelines?,"A declarative pipeline is a simpler, more structured approach, whereas a scripted pipeline provides more flexibility with custom logic using Groovy scripting."
How can Jenkins pipelines be triggered?,"Jenkins pipelines can be triggered by events like code commits, manual triggers, or scheduled intervals, making automation flexible and event-driven."
What is the role of Jenkinsfile in pipelines?,A Jenkinsfile is a configuration file where the pipeline is defined. It includes all stages and steps of the pipeline and is version-controlled alongside the project.
How do you run tests in a Jenkins pipeline?,"Tests are typically added as a step within a Jenkins pipeline using testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Selenium) to automate the execution and reporting of results."
What is parallel execution in Jenkins pipelines?,"Jenkins pipelines support parallel execution of stages, allowing multiple tasks to be run simultaneously, improving efficiency in CI/CD workflows."
How can you handle failures in Jenkins pipelines?,Jenkins pipelines allow error handling using the try/catch block or built-in retry steps to handle failures and ensure pipeline stability during execution.
What is the purpose of Jenkins pipeline agents?,"Jenkins pipeline agents define the environment where the pipeline will run, such as a specific node or Docker container, to execute the pipeline steps."
How can Jenkins pipelines be integrated with Docker?,"Jenkins pipelines can integrate with Docker by using Docker agents or running Docker commands in pipeline steps, enabling containerized builds and deployments."
